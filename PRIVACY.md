## 🛡️ The "No Personal Financial Data" Promise

Your portfolio is **yours alone**.

- **All calculations happen in your browser.** Your stock positions, share counts, cost basis, and performance data never leave your device.
- **Data is stored locally.** Your portfolio lives in your browser's `localStorage`. We cannot access it, retrieve it, or transmit it anywhere.
- **No accounts. No logins. No cloud sync.** There is no server-side database storing your information. If you clear your browser data, your portfolio is gone—because it only ever existed on your machine.

We believe your financial information is deeply personal. BogleConvert was designed from the ground up to ensure that privacy is not a feature—it's the architecture.
