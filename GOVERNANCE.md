# Project Governance & Succession Pledge

**Steward:** Mid Michigan Connections LLC ("The LLC")
**Project:** BogleConvert

## 1. Our Philosophy
We believe financial tools should be transparent, accessible, and durable. While The LLC currently maintains the infrastructure and code, this project belongs to the Community.

## 2. Community Rights
The LLC pledges that the "Community Edition" of this software will always remain Open Source under the **AGPLv3 License**. We will never re-license the existing open-source code base to a closed-source license that revokes your rights to the current version.

## 3. The "Succession Pledge" (The Kill Switch)
In the event that Mid Michigan Connections LLC ceases active maintenance of this project for a period of **18 consecutive months**, or explicitly announces the discontinuation of the project:

1.  **Right to Fork:** The Community has the irrevocable right to fork the project, including the use of the name "BogleConvert" for the purpose of continuing the project as a Non-Profit or Community-Led initiative.
2.  **Asset Transfer:** The LLC agrees to negotiate in good faith the transfer of the domain name, the associated GitHub repository, and all rights, title, and interest in the software source code to a bona fide US-based Non-Profit Organization (501(c)(3)) formed by the active core contributors.
